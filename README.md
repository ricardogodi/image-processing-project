# image-processing-project
This project provides a console-based image processing tool in C# and F#. It reads PPM image files, applies various operations (grayscale, threshold, flip horizontal, edge detection, right-rotate 90), and writes the processed image back to PPM format. It was created by Prof. Joe Hummel and modified by Pat Troy, UIC.
